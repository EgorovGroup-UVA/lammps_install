# lammps_tutorials
The purpose of this repository is to have the completed input scripts for https://lammpstutorials.github.io/ readily accessible. Admittedly, the GCMC tutorial and cracking Silica are not done yet. 

Further, make sure you follow the instructions of the site and make sure the file structure mathces what's listed on the site; that and making sure the names of the files you read in match within the LAMMPS scripts themselves. Ex. being the Level 1 Graphene under Deformation instructions.
